UE4 level transition effect

We can create similar effect using the plugin:

Not all assets are included inside this plugin, you need to create your own scene capture, and then update your scene capture corresponding to your actual camera.
Then you can adjust Material Collection Parameter's RadiusOffset parameter to transition between two different levels.
